          Hello World! My name is Sean Haboon, and I am studying with the goal
          to become a software-engineer of the full-stack flavor.

          I am live in Greensboro, NC and am currently enrolled in the UNCC
          Full-Stack Coding bootcamp.

          I have always been drawn to technology as a child. While it was on the
          more destructive side, I took apart everything I could and
          familiarized myself with its contents. As I have grown, I grew my
          ability to dissect and understand the inner workings of most things
          presented to me. While late to the field, I finally stumbled upon
          web-related code via FreeCodeCamp and a friend and found a slight
          affinity to it. While I may not be the most well-studied individual, I
          am fast at picking up nuiances and am always willing to learn.
